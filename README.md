# Hi there 👋 
I build small things that sometimes grow big.  
Full-stack developer & indie hacker based in Korea 🇰🇷  (About to move to Brazil)
I love turning ideas into real, usable products —  
from **concept → code → launch** 🚀  

### 🔍 I'm recently interested in  
- 🤖 **AI/ML** — integrating LLMs into real-world apps  
- 🧱 **Clean Architecture** — scalable and maintainable systems  
- 🧪 **TDD & CI/CD** — building reliable software from day one  
- 🌐 **Product Growth & Startup Scaling** — bridging tech and business
